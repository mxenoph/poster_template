# Poster template in LaTeX

Notes:
* It's really difficult to get the figures where you want them on the poster and to keep everything in a single page
* The abbr1au.bst files was created with `latex makebst`. It sets the style of bibliography to author (year) journal, volume:pages
* On OS X Yosemite compiling the file leads to errors (`dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/X11/lib/libXt.6.dylib`) due to path to X11. Installing the latest XQuartz fixes the error (http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/208001/cant-compile-image-after-upgrading-to-os-x-yosemite).
